# Art-generation-with-neural-style-transfer
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. Basically, it merges two images, namely, a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S.
